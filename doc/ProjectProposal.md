# Project Name
PokeBook

## Proejct Summary:
///
For our Project, we will be accessing databases with pokemons. We want user to be able to eaily search for pokemon information by name, number, type and ability. We also provides some useful tools to help user have a better understanding of battle strategy based on strengths and weaknesses of each type.

## Description:
In this particular project, we are creating an interactive website in which we will provide some insights on Pokemon games based on existing database and API. This website is mostly Pokemon-fans based and will provide overviews and efficient queries for users. For optimal results, are accumulating data for every generation of Pokemon.   
The fundamental information we are trying to provide basically comes in four categories:  
1.	Pokemon search. 
2.	Ranking of 属性. 
3.	克制关系图. 
4.	Simulation of team formation and 养成. 

## Problems:
There are various websites, forums, and even APIs about Pokemon. We will elaborate problems of each source in the following paragraphs respectively.
There are countless websites about Pokemon topics, but most of them do not even support basic queries and a considerable amount of them leads users to other websites when they wish to inquire specific information about Pokemon. This trend has greatly lengthened users’ time spent on searching desired data, which violates the purpose of providing quick access and queries of data.  
Taking a brief look at forums around us, we can find that forums are basically made up by long segments of texts, and users has to read them through in order to acquire desired information. In terms of data visualization and delivery, a search engine (website) about Pokemon can serve the purpose of providing quick and specific information with more efficacy.  
APIs are good ways to accumulate information, however, only a limited number of the population can to coding, needless to say performing various operations on APIs. What we need is a platform to synthesize millions of data tuples and select desired and relevant data for users.

## Project work distribution:
jinyuy2 and jialinh4 will work primarily on the front-end. This includes tasks such as creating the webpage UI, communicating to and from the backend, optimizing user experience, and classifying all categories in an appropriate manner.   
  
yifan20 and faruhan2 will work primarily on the back-end. This includes tasks such as selecting data from the user's request, processing the data, and sending back the necessary info to the front end. We are still deciding on frameworks to use for the frontend and backend.
